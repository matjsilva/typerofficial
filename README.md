### Changelog

Typer is on version 1.0.0, this is the changelog for this version:

- Typer is live!

## Why did i created Typer?

This all starts with me and my friends competing with each other to see who was the best at typing, that was fun and we really enjoyed it, but we used to test it on websites where you just type and get a number, i wanted more. That's why i created Typer, i wanted a REAL game for typing tests, where you get a rank, and where you have a story, a reputation. Well, i have to admit that League of Legends have inspired me though.

## Am i going to update Typer frequently?

Well, actually not. Yes, Typer is a huge project and looks like it needs some updates, but i just created it for fun, but it doesn't mean that i won't update it, i will, but not as a main project of mine.

## I want to contribute at Typer, how can i do this?

Speak with me! Every good plan starts with communication, you can add me on discord adding my account
